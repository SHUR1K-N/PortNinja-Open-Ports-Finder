This project was created in Python, for security research purposes.

## Optimization
Multithreading was implemented in this program to create a dedicated software thread for each socket to connect to a dedicated port of the specified target (i.e. 65,536 threads/sockets are briefly created). All these created sockets/threads connect to their individual dedicated ports concurrently; maximizing an optimal scan rate.
