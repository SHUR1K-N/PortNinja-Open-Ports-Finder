<p>Example Execution</p>

This project was created in Python, for security research purposes.

## Optimization
Multithreading was implemented in this program to create a dedicated software thread for each socket to connect to a dedicated port of the specified target (i.e. 65,536 threads/sockets are briefly created). All these created sockets/threads connect to their individual dedicated ports concurrently; maximizing an optimal scan rate.

## Note
PortNinja does *not* perform a stealthy scan, that is, it works on the basis of establishing the complete three-way handshake instead of just sending a SYN flagged packet followed by the RST flagged packet (as it would in a SYN scan). PortNinja terminates each connection with its individual port properly by the time that individual port has been scanned; but this in itself does not by any means dictate that the target will not be aware of all these sudden connection attempts through all of its ports that are being "scanned" by PortNinja.
